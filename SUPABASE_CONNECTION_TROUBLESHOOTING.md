# Supabase Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Description

The application is experiencing connection errors when attempting to connect to Supabase. The specific error is:

```
Error: Cannot find module './definitions.js'
Require stack:
- C:\Users\panto\npm-cache\_npx\53c4795544aaa350\node_modules\@deno\shim-deno-test\dist\test.js
- C:\Users\panto\npm-cache\_npx\53c4795544aaa350\node_modules\@deno\shim-deno-test\dist\index.js
- C:\Users\panto\npm-cache\_npx\53c4795544aaa350\node_modules\@deno\shim-deno\dist\deno\stable\functions\test.js
...
```

This error indicates a dependency conflict between Deno shim packages and the Supabase client library. The error occurs because the system cannot find the required `definitions.js` module in the `@deno/shim-deno-test` package.

## Root Cause Analysis (PGSD Framework)

### Probability
- **Most Likely Cause (70%)**: Corrupted or incomplete npm cache leading to missing module files
- **Secondary Cause (20%)**: Version mismatch between Deno shims and Supabase packages
- **Tertiary Cause (10%)**: Incorrect application configuration trying to use Deno-specific features in a Node.js environment

### Game Theory
- The conflict represents a classic compatibility game between different package ecosystems (Deno vs. Node.js)
- The optimal strategy is to use native Node.js packages rather than Deno shims for Supabase integration

### Supply & Demand
- There is demand for Deno compatibility in Node.js environments
- The supply (shims) is not fully mature, leading to compatibility issues
- Using native packages has a higher reliability supply chain

## Recommended Solutions (In Priority Order)

### 1. Clear NPM Cache and Reinstall Dependencies

```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

This addresses the highest probability cause - corrupted cache files. It removes all cached package data and forces a clean reinstall.

### 2. Use Standard Node.js Approach

Update the Supabase client implementation to use the standard Node.js approach:

```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

// Create a single supabase client for interacting with your database
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
);
```

Avoid using any Deno-specific tooling or approaches when working with Supabase in a Next.js environment.

### 3. Verify Environment Variables

Ensure the `.env.local` file contains the correct Supabase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 4. Update Supabase Dependencies

```bash
npm update @supabase/supabase-js
```

This ensures you're using the latest version with bug fixes and compatibility improvements.

### 5. Reinstall Specific Problem Packages

```bash
npm uninstall @deno/shim-deno-test @deno/shim-deno
npm install @deno/shim-deno-test @deno/shim-deno
```

This specifically targets the problematic packages for a clean reinstall.

## Preventative Measures

1. **Avoid Mixing Ecosystems**: Stick to either Node.js or Deno patterns, but not both in the same application
2. **Use Official Packages**: Prefer official Supabase packages for your environment
3. **Test in CI/CD**: Add connection tests to catch these issues early
4. **Package Lockfiles**: Always commit package-lock.json to ensure consistent installations

## Monitoring Next Steps

After implementing a solution, monitor for:
1. Successful connection to Supabase services
2. Performance of database operations
3. Any new errors in the application logs
