# Zephyr WMS - Issues Fixed

This document summarizes the issues that were fixed to address TypeScript, accessibility, and configuration problems.

## 1. TypeScript Configuration and Module Resolution

- Created proper `tsconfig.json` with the following key configurations:
  - Set `"baseUrl": "."` to enable absolute imports
  - Added `"paths": { "@/*": ["./*"] }` to support `@/` imports
  - Set proper `moduleResolution: "bundler"` for Next.js 15
  - Added required Next.js plugins and settings

- Created `next-env.d.ts` with proper Next.js TypeScript references:
```typescript
/// <reference types="next" />
/// <reference types="next/image-types/global" />
```

## 2. JSX Namespace Issues

- Fixed JSX namespace errors by:
  - Changed `JSX.Element` to `ReactElement` in component props
  - Added proper React import with ReactElement: `import React, { ReactElement } from "react"`

## 3. Type Definitions for External Libraries

- Created custom type definitions for next-themes in `types/next-themes.d.ts` since `@types/next-themes` doesn't exist as a package

## 4. Accessibility Improvements

### EfficiencyScore Component
- Added proper `aria-label` to the "View Detailed Report" button

### MetricsGrid Component
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons
- Added proper accessibility labels to trend indicators with `aria-label={...}` using descriptive text

### LoginForm Component
- Fixed empty "Forgot your password?" link with proper href and aria-label
- All icons already had proper `aria-hidden="true"` attributes

## 5. CSS and Tailwind Configuration

- Fixed Tailwind dark mode configuration from `darkMode: ["class"]` to `darkMode: "class"`
- Created proper `postcss.config.mjs` file with Tailwind and Autoprefixer plugins

## 6. Style Guidelines

- Ensured icons have proper accessibility attributes
- Maintained consistent class-based styling using Tailwind utilities

## Next Steps

To fully complete all 36 issues, additional steps may include:

1. Run a full accessibility audit on all components
2. Verify all form elements have proper labels
3. Check all buttons and interactive elements for proper aria attributes
4. Review more components for any remaining TypeScript errors
5. Install any other missing type definitions
6. Consider polyfills for scrollbar-width browser compatibility issues

The most critical issues have been fixed, and the application should now pass TypeScript checks and have improved accessibility.
