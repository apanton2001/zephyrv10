# Zephyr Warehouse Management System - Deployment Checklist

This checklist covers everything needed to deploy the Zephyr Warehouse Management System to Vercel with automatic updates via Cline.

## 1. Pre-Deployment Preparation

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create `.env.local` file with production environment variables
- [ ] Ensure all environment variables are properly referenced in the application
- [ ] Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` to prevent committing secrets

### Production Optimization
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` to fix any linting issues
- [ ] Run `npm run build` locally to catch any build errors
- [ ] Verify Tailwind CSS purging is properly configured
- [ ] Check image optimization settings in `next.config.mjs`
- [ ] Update `next.config.mjs` with any production-specific settings

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Test all API endpoints with production configuration
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for API routes
- [ ] Add rate-limiting to API routes if necessary
- [ ] Ensure mock data is replaced with real data sources or keep mock data clearly labeled

### Security Checks
- [ ] Review authentication implementation
- [ ] Ensure all protected routes have proper authorization checks
- [ ] Remove any hardcoded credentials or replace with environment variables
- [ ] Verify CORS settings if applicable

## 2. Version Control Setup

### Git Repository
- [ ] Create a GitHub repository (if not already done)
- [ ] Ensure the `.gitignore` file is properly configured
- [ ] Push the latest version to the repository
- [ ] Create a `production` branch for deployment

### Branch Protection
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules for `main` and `production` branches
- [ ] Configure required reviews for pull requests to protected branches
- [ ] Set up status checks if applicable (CI/CD)

## 3. Vercel Deployment

### Vercel Account Setup
- [ ] Create or login to Vercel account
- [ ] Set up a team if collaborating with others
- [ ] Connect GitHub account to Vercel

### Project Configuration
- [ ] Import the GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure the production branch (`production` or `main`)
- [ ] Set up environment variables in Vercel project settings
- [ ] Configure domain settings (custom domain if applicable)
- [ ] Set build settings (usually auto-detected for Next.js)

### Deployment Settings
- [ ] Enable preview deployments for pull requests
- [ ] Configure automatic deployments from the production branch
- [ ] Set up deployment notifications (email, Slack, etc.)
- [ ] Configure serverless function settings if needed

## 4. Cline Integration for Deployments

### Setup for Cline Access
- [ ] Ensure GitHub credentials are accessible to Cline
- [ ] Generate personal access token if needed for Cline to push changes
- [ ] Configure any needed SSH keys for secure connections

### Workflow Configuration
- [ ] Create standard commands for Cline to execute for deployment
  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "Description of changes"
  git push origin production
  ```
- [ ] Create deployment commands file for Cline to reference
- [ ] Document the Cline deployment process in the project README

## 5. Post-Deployment Verification

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test login functionality with demo credentials
- [ ] Verify all pages load correctly
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations
- [ ] Verify responsive design on various devices
- [ ] Check dark/light mode functionality

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audits for performance, accessibility, SEO
- [ ] Verify page load times are acceptable
- [ ] Test resource loading and optimization
- [ ] Check for any console errors

### Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up usage analytics if applicable
- [ ] Verify logs are properly capturing important events

## 6. Rollback Plan

### Backup Strategy
- [ ] Document the process for rolling back to previous versions
- [ ] Ensure database backups are in place if applicable
- [ ] Document how to revert to a specific git commit

### Emergency Procedures
- [ ] Create a list of emergency contacts
- [ ] Document steps for quick fixes to common issues
- [ ] Establish criteria for when to initiate a rollback

## 7. Documentation Updates

### User Documentation
- [ ] Update user documentation with production URLs
- [ ] Create any necessary user guides for production environment
- [ ] Document known differences between development and production

### Developer Documentation
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Document the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for deployment issues

## Cline Deployment Command Reference

When using Cline to deploy changes to Vercel, use the following format:

```
I need to deploy changes to the warehouse management system. The changes include [brief description]. Please:

1. Stage all changes
2. Commit with an appropriate message
3. Push to the production branch, which will trigger automatic deployment on Vercel
4. Confirm the deployment was successful
```

Cline will then execute the necessary Git commands and provide status updates throughout the process.
